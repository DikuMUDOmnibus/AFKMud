Name i3deny
Perm Imm
Text Syntax: i3deny <person> <local channel name>
Syntax: i3deny <person> [tell/beep/finger]

This command allows you to selectively ban certain users from using channels,
tells, beeps, and finger commands. Multiple denials can be imposed, but if you
should find you need to deny all of these options, it might well be worth looking
at setting their permissions to None instead.

#HELP
Name i3chanlist
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3chanlist [filter|all]

Displays a listing of configured channels the mud is currently tuned into.

If a filter is specified, it will display all channels which contain the
filter value in their names or host muds.

Specifying all will show you every I3 channel available on the router the
mud is connected to.

Text Syntax: i3mudlist [filter|all]

Displays a listing of muds currently connected to the network.

If a filter value is specified, all muds who's names, types, or mudlibs which
contain the filter value will be shown.

If all is specified, then all connections whether up or down will be shown.
This can be a very spammy listing.

#HELP
Name i3chanwho
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3chanwho <local channel> <mud>

Displays a list of users who are listening to a particular channel on the
specified mud. This command will not display such a listing for the entire
network due to the sheer number of connected muds. Such a display would
constitute screens full of scrolling.

Name i3invis
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3invis

Toggles your invisibility state on I3. While invisible, you will not be seen
on who listings, be unable to send or receive tells, be unable to send or
receive beeps, and be unable to send or receive finger requests. This
invisibility state will not conceal you from channel messages you initiate.

This toggle is also unrelated to your local invisibility flags as a player.

As an immortal, this state acts separately from your wizinvis state. If you
are also wizinvis, that will take priority over i3invis.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3color
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3color

Toggles your ability to see color on I3. This acts apart from your mud's
ANSI state, so if your mud has no inbuilt color system, you will still be
able to see colors on I3 if this has been enabled.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3mudlisten

#HELP
Name i3addchan
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3addchan <channelname> <localname> <type>

The channelname should be what shows up on the router's list and is displayed
on the 'i3chanlist all' command.

Localname should be the local name you want it listed as on the mud.

Type can be one of the following:

0: selectively banned
1: selectively admitted
2: filtered - valid for selectively admitted ONLY

Selectively banned channels are public channels, open to all.
Selectively admitted channels are private channels, by invite only.

Filtering is not yet implemented in this client code, but is used to scrub
the content of a private channel by its host before it is sent out to those who are
subscribed. As noted, this CANNOT be done on a public channel ( yet ).

New channels default to "Mort" permission.

See I3PERMSET for more information on what permissions do.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3adminchan
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3adminchan <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>

This command is used to administer the list of muds authorized to use a channel.

When used with a public channel, "add" bans them from using it, and "remove" unbans them.
When used with a private channel, "add" allows them to use it, and "remove" disallows them.

This is all handled on a per mud basis.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3ban
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3ban <target>
Syntax: i3ban IP:Port

This is the mud-wide version of an I3IGNORE command. Best used in elevated cases
where indivudual users have been unable to effectively block traffic from another
user or mud who is harassing them, or harassing multiple users on your mud.
This is a somewhat drastic measure and all traffic from the individual user or
mud will be dropped silently. It is usually best to have documented cases of
individual abuse before proceeding to this level. If blocking at this level fails
to stop the problem, you may wish to proceed to the administrator of the channel
if the problem is channel related, or directly to the router administration for
the router you are connected to if it's something else. Be prepared to provide
any necessary documentation of incidents if the administrator you contact should
request them.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3beep
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>
Syntax: i3beep [on]/[off]

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

Using on or off as an argument will enable or disable your ability
to send and receive i3beeps.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3chanlayout
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3chanlayout <localchannel> <layout> <format...>
Layout can be one of these: layout_e layout_m

Format can be any way you want it to look, provided you have the proper number of %s tags in it.

layout_e designs require 2 %s tags, one for the channel localname, and one for the message itself.

layout_m designs require 4 %s tags. One for the channel localname, one for the username, one for
the mudname, and one for the message itself.

Formats with incorrect amounts of tags will be rejected.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3config
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3config <options>

The interface to changing your configuration while in the mud.
Most options listed by typing in the command cannot be changed if you are currently
connected to I3 and they will inform you of this.

'i3config show' will list the details of what you can currently change with this
command. If something is not listed, then the only means to change it is to edit it
in shell. The output of the command should be fairly self explainitory.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3connect
Perm Imm
Text Syntax: i3connect [router]

Does more or less what it implies: Connects the mud to the I3 network.

If a router is specified, then that router will be the one connected to.
If no router is specified, then the router listed first in the mud's router
configuration will be used.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3disconnect

Text Syntax: i3disconnect

Does more or less what it implies: Disconnects the mud from the I3 network.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3debug
Perm Imp
Text Syntax: i3debug

When this option is on, all packets entering and leaving the mud are logged so
that they can be inspected later. This is really only of any value in the
deployment of new packet types that have not been tested, or in the addition of
new features that have yet to be implemented. It is not to be used lightly, for
it spams and is a gross invasion of privacy for anyone on the mud who may be
using tells. Responsible admins should either inform their users ahead of time or
use this option on a development port.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3editchan
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3editchan <localname> localname <new localname>
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> level <permission>

This allows you to change the local name of a channel, or to change the permission
level at which players can begin using it.

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

#HELP
Name i3finger
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3finger <person@mud>
Syntax: i3finger privacy

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

Using the privacy argument will disable your information from being
sent to a requesting user on another mud. You will not be told anyone
has tried.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3ignore
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3ignore <target>
Syntax: i3ignore IP:Port

The I3IGNORE command blocks incoming traffic directed at a specific user on the mud.
It also prevents them from being displayed on such lists as who, and channel who.
This is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify ignores either specifically or with wildcards, like so:

i3ignore pest@mud
i3ignore *@mud
i3ignore pest@*
i3ignore IP:Port

The IP type of ignore can only be specified as an IP and port, taken from the mud's
current mudinfo data. This will block anyone current and future who logs into that
mud IP and port from ever sending you traffic.

Before going to the mud's administration with a complain, you should attempt to make
an ignore work for you. If the particular person is still causing problems or is
making a nuisance of themselves to several people, advise your mud administration
that they may need to pursue an I3BAN against the person or mud in question.
Be prepared to show proper documentation of any incidents to support your case.

#HELP
Name i3locate
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

#HELP
Name i3permset
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3permset <user> <permission>

This command sets the permission level for a particular user on your mud.
The following permissions are available:

Notset - Default value. Causes subsequent logins to reset perms based on level.
None   - No access.
Mort   - Allows access to channels and commands for non-staff players.
Imm    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for regular staff.
Admin  - Allows access to additional channels and commands for administrative staff.
Imp    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for implementors.

These permission values are also used when setting channels up for access.

#HELP
Name i3removechan
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3removechan <channel>

Channelname should be the name seen on 'i3chanlist all'

Removed the indicated channel from the router, and deletes the local copy from the
mud as well. This does NOT send a broadcast to subscribed muds to delete their local
copies, so they will need to do that themselves upon noticing the channel is gone.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3setchan
Perm Admin
Text Syntax: i3setchan <i3channelname> <localname> [permission]

This creates a local copy of an existing I3 channel for the mud to subscribe to.
You must use the I3 name of the channel so that your mud will know which one you
want. This is obtained from the 'i3chanlist all' command. You must then supply
a local channel name to use with it. Then you can optionally set a permission level
at which players can start using the channel. Channels with no permission level
supplied will default to "Mort".

An example:

i3setchan diku_chat dchat mort

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

End

#HELP
Name i3tell
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3tell [on]/[off]

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

Using the on or off arguments will enable or disable your ability to send
and receive i3tells.
¢
End

#HELP
Name i3reply
Perm Mort
Text Syntax: i3reply <message>

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
