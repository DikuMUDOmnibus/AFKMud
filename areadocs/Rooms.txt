      #<vnum of next room....>
      .
      .
      .
      .
      #0

The <vnum> is the virtual number of the room.

The <name> is the name of the room.

The <description> is the long multi-line description of the room.
This description is the one chosen by default, and during daytime for the room.

The <nighttime description> is the long multi-line description of the room
as it appears at night, assuming you wish to specify one.

The <sector-type> identifies the type of terrain.  This affects movement cost
through the room.  Certain sector types (air and water) require special
capabilities to enter. The following is a list of sector types:

Sector:      | Move | Description
-------------+------+-------------

water_noswim | 2    | Water.  Boat required to enter.

Note that indoors, underground, underwater, and oceanfloors do not prevent the display of weather messages and the like.  To do that, the indoors room flag is required.

Lava and tundra sectors do damage to characters enterting them.  This damage is 20 if not protected, 10 if resistant to fire and cold respectively, and 0 if immune.

The <options?> value is used to tell the mud that the room contains
some additional data in it. Enter a 0 if no optional data is being used,
or a 1 if it is. Optional values need to be placed on the same line as the
1 if they are being specified.

The teledelay specifies an optional delay to teleport everyone out of the
room and into the room specified by televnum. Requires the roomflags
'teleport', 'teleshowdesc', or 'telenofly' in order for these values to function.

The tunnel value specifies how many people are allowed to fit inside
a room flagged as a tunnel. Requires the roomflag 'tunnel' in order
to work.

The <room-flags> describe more attributes of the room. 
The following chart lists the valid room flag values:
Separate flag names with a space or the code will not recognize them.

Auction houses require that the next vnum used be set aside to use as a storage
room for the items, much like a petshop. Be sure and flag the storage room with the appropriate flags so no players can get in, or the mobs can get out.  There must also be a mob in the room with the AUCTION flag.

-----

To create a watchtower: 
 
in the room you want the tower connected to, make an exit in whichever 
direction you choose, though up usually makes the most sense. 
Flag it as overland, and optionally ( though HIGHLY recommended ) as nomob. 
This exit can lead to any vnum you want, but it would be a Really Bad Plan(tm) 
to assign this to an existing overland room. You then need to assign it 
coordinates for where on the overland the watchtower is supposed to be. 
 
Example for how to setup the source room: 
 
redit exit up 7035 overland nomob 
redit excoord up 468 380 
 
In the room that will be the tower, flag it as "map" and as "watchtower" and 
then make an exit that returns to the room you just made. 
 
Example for how to setup the target room: 
 
redit flags map watchtower 
redit exit down 7004 
 
That should do it, and you should end up with a nice view of the overland :)

-----

Unlike mobiles and objects, rooms don't have any keywords associated with them.
One may not manipulate a room in the same way one manipulates a mobile or
object.

The optional 'D' sections and 'E' sections come after the main data.
A 'D' section contains a 'door', chosen from the following list:

DIRECTION
---------------
north
east
south
west
up
down
northeast
northwest
southeast
southwest
somewhere ( usually a portal type exit )
  
A 'D' command also contains an <exit description> for that direction, 
and <exit keywords> for manipulating the door. Doors include not just 
real doors, but any kind of exit from the room.

<exit flags> describe additional properties of the exit.
Separate exit flags with a space or the code will not recognize them.

NAME        | DESCRIPTION OF TYPE              
---------------------------------------------------
isdoor      | There is a door in that direction ( required if it's actually intended to be a door )
closed      | The door is closed
locked      | The door is locked
isbolt      | Door a bolt on it
bolted      | Door has been bolted shut
secret      | Door is Secret, Trying to go that way won't reveal door
searchable  | Searching in this direction can remove the SECRET flag
swim        | Must be able to swim to go that way (or have a boat or float)
pickproof   | Door is Pickproof (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
bashproof   | Door cannot be bashed down
fly         | Must be able to fly to go that way
climb       | Must be able to climb to go that way
dig         | Passage is blocked and must be dug out
eatkey      | Door will eat the key used to open it
nopassdoor  | Door is impervious to the passdoor spell
hidden      | Door is not "obvious" -- doesn't appear with autoexits
overland    | Exit leads out to the overland map ( see below )
nomob       | Mobs cannot travel out this exit - recommended to use with the OVERLAND flag
arrowslit   | Exit is an arrowslit, can see through, fire arrows, but otherwise acts as a wall
window      | Can see through this exit, otherwise acts as a wall
fortified   | A heavily fortified wall - can be attacked
heavy       | A fortified wall - can be attacked*
medium      | A sturdy wall - can be attacked*
light       | An ordinary wall - can be attacked*
crumbling   | A wall on its last legs, one more attack destroys it*
can_climb   | Can use the climb command to go this way
can_enter   | Can use the enter command to go this way
can_leave   | Can use the leave command to go this way
can_look    | Can look into this exit
auto        | Keyword can be typed to go this way
noflee      | Players and mobs cannot flee through this exit

Note: Swim exit flag has not been implemented yet.

* Attackable walls can only be damaged by siege engines - which don't yet exist in game.
  Each grade of wall is stronger than the one below it. When setting wall flags, only
  use one flag, combining them will only result in the greatest flag being acknowleged.

You must specify two 'D' sections, one for each side of the door. If you
specify just one then you'll get a one-way exit.

Exits with the OVERLAND flag need to have a set of coordinates added to them.
These coordinates are determined by the location on the map where the area
is supposed to exit out. Check with your KL to get these. Your KL is also
responsible for adding the overland link into your area.

The <key> value is the vnum of an object which locks and unlocks the door.
A value of -1 signifies the door does not have a key.

<to_room> is the vnum of the room to which this door leads.

<x-coord> and <y-coord> specify the coordinates on the overland map that this
exit leads out to.

<pulltype> and <pull> will be further explained when more is known about them.
In the meantime, leave them out.

An 'E' section (extended description) contains a <keywords> string and a
<description> string. As you might guess, looking at one of the words in
'keywords' yields the 'description' string.

The 'S' at the end marks the end of the room.  It is not optional.

#0

The #0 is to be placed on a new line at the end of your LAST room in the area.

The following is an example of a completed room:

#1610
Thag's Garden of Serenity~
The door from the hallway leads you into a large garden, open to the
air.  Large walls of stone surround you, each covered in various
creeping vines.  Various types of trees provide the next layer, and 
under the trees are any number of beautiful bushes and flowers.  The 
central area of the garden is all sand, raked in strange patterns 
around a number of very interesting looking rocks.  A stream flows 
from out of nowhere through the southeast corner of the garden, and a 
small redwood bridge crosses it.  Small stones lead from the bridge to 
the exact center of the garden, which is a small grassy area under a 
large fir tree.  A small shrine has been set up under the tree.  The 
garden radiates an aura of calm and peacefulness, and you get the 
feeling that all is right with the world.

Shrine~
The shrine is nothing more than a small stone, carved with a number of 
designs, all surrounding the symbol of an open eye in the center of the 
stone.  Small offerings of food and water sit next to the shrine.

rock rocks~
The rocks are of many different sizes and shapes, but every one
possesses a strange kind of beauty you cannot quite put a finger on.
Looking at the stones, you imagine seeing any number of fantastic scenes.

E
pattern patterns~
The patterns make no sense at all, forming no recognizable shape, but 
somehow flow smoothly around the scattered stones, enhancing the 
peacefulness and beauty of the garden.
