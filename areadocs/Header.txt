=== The #AREA section (also referred to as the header)

Last Modified by Samson, 6/19/03

The syntax of this section is:


#AREA	<area-name>~

The name of the area.

#VERSION <value>

Specifies the version of the area file.
Version 0 is for Smaug 1.02a format files, Version 1 is for
Smaug 1.4a files. Versions between 2 and 16 are not supported by AFKMud.

The current area version is 19, so make any new areas with a 19 in the
version field.

#AUTHOR  <author-name>~

The name of the Builder who created this area.

#VNUMS <low> <high>

Specifies the vnum range for the entire area. Please be sure that your
vnums don't conflict with another area, as it will prevent this one from
loading, and possibly crash the mud as well.

#RANGES
<val1> <val2> <val3> <val4>
$

The first two numbers are recommended level range, while the last 2 
numbers are the enforced level range. Enforced level range means that
a player outside that range will NOT be able to enter the zone. Unless
your zone is strictly intended for newbies or immortals only, it should
be set to enforced range of 0 to 115.

#RESETMSG <message>~

The message displayed to players by the mud when the area is 
repopulated. It is a good idea to try and come up with one that makes
sense for the entire area. If you have half indoors, and half outdoors,
your repopulation message should make sense to the player no matter
where in the zone they are.

#RESETFREQUENCY <value>

The <value> setting sets the amount of time before an area is to reset
itself. Leaving this section out defaults to a 15 minute reset timer.

#FLAGS
<string>~

The <string> setting here determines the area flags for this zone.
Separate multiple flags with a space or the code won't recognize any
of them. They are case-sensitive, so enter them as listed.
These settings override any roomflags set for individual rooms 
in an area, so be careful when setting these. They affect an entire zone.

FLAG NAME     | DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
nopkill	      | No Pkillers are allowed in this zone.
nocamp        | Players cannot camp anywhere in this zone.
noastral      | Players may not astral walk from or to this zone.
noportal      | Players may not portal to or from this zone.
norecall      | Players may not recall from this zone.
nosummon      | Players may not summon to or from this zone.
noscry        | Players may not use the farsight spell in this zone.
noteleport    | Players may not teleport to or from this zone.
freekill      | Treats the entire zone as an arena. Get approval first.
nobeacon      | Players may not set recall beacons in this zone.
noquit        | Players may not quit while in this area.

#CONTINENT <name>~

This header determines what continent or plane an area is on.
For the most part, your continent will be determined by what
building kingdom you build for. Check with your KL if you are
not sure what continent your area goes on.

Name         |  Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
Alsherok     | For a zone connected on the main continent of Alsherok.
Eletar       | For a zone connected on the continent of Eletar.
Alatia       | For a zone connected on the continent of Alatia.
Astral       | For a zone connected to the Astral Plane.
Past         | For a zone set in the distant past.
Immortal     | For a zone connected to the immortal plane.
Varsis       | Only used for a zone which is part of the Immortal Trials.

#COORDS <x> <y>

The X and Y coordinates of this zone on the overland. When picking
coordinates, use the center of the area on the map as your reference.
Doesn't need to be exact, just close. If your area is not connecting
directly to the overland, it still needs coordinates. Go to the area
you are connecting to, and use it's coordinates. If that area also is
not connected to the overland, keep going until you find the nearest
area that DOES, and use its coordinates. Keep in mind that current
coordinate range is 0 to 999 in both directions.

#CLIMATE <value1> <value2> <value3>

This sets the climate for your area. These values affect the severity of
weather within the zone. More information on this will be available
when we understand it all better. Or better yet, refer to the online
helpfiles. They probably explain it fairly well.

The <value1> setting is the temperature range, <value2> is the precipitation,
and <value3> is the wind. Refer to the following tables.

Value1 | Temperature   Value2 | Precipitation   Value3 | Wind
--------------------   ----------------------   ----------------
    0  | Cold               0 | Arid                 0 | Still
    1  | Cool               1 | Dry                  1 | Calm
    2  | Normal             2 | Normal               2 | Normal 
    3  | Warm               3 | Damp                 3 | Breezy
    4  | Hot                4 | Wet                  4 | Windy

#TREASURE
<val1> <val2> <val3> <val4>
<val5> <val6> <val7> <val8>

These set the random chances of generating a certain type of random
treasure for this area. If this section is left out, the code will
adpot some default settings based on the original hardcoded formulas.

<val1> is the chance to generate nothing at all.
<val2> is the chance to generate some gold.
<val3> is the chance to generate a random item, which is further broken
down by <val5> through <val8>
<val4> is the chance to generate a gem.
Runes are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings runes will not be generated at all for this area.

<val5> is the chance to generate a random scroll.
<val6> is the chance to generate a random potion.
<val7> is the chance to generate a random wand.
<val8> is the chance to generate a random armor, which may have item sockets
for rune insertion.
Weapons are generated based on the values above, and if you exceed 100% in any
of the previous 4 settings, weapons will not be generated at all for this area.
Further, weapons can also randomly be assigned item sockets for rune insertion.

#NEIHGBOR <area name>~

This specifies what area(s) affect the climate in this area. To specify
more than one, a seperate #NEIGHBOR field is required for each.

Below is an example of a completed header section:

#AREA   Halls of the Gods~

#VERSION 18

#AUTHOR All~

#VNUMS 1200 1499

#RANGES
100 115 100 115
$

#RESETMSG An ether storm produces a brilliant display of colors.~

#RESETFREQUENCY 60

#FLAGS

#CONTINENT immortal~

#COORDS 0 0

#CLIMATE 2 2 2

#NEIGHBOR Challenge of Immortality~

This ends the header information. Refer to the Mobiles.txt file to
